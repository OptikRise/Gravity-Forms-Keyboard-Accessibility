# Gravity Forms Keyboard Accessibility

This is a simple plugin for Gravity Forms (specifically the existing "Quiz" addon) that allows the use of a keyboard for accessibility purposes.

We received word from our Office of Disability Services that keyboard users were submitting the forms early when using 'enter' to select an input. This plugin is a result of that.
